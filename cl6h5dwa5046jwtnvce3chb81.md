## Getting Set For My Software Engineering Training

> "The secret of making progress is to get started." - Mark Twain

In my previous article, I mentioned having been accepted for the 12-month ALX Software Engineering program. The program requires the commitment of a minimum of 70 hours per week to training activities and tasks. And being accepted to the program does not guarantee completion. There is a major criterion for participants to proceed beyond the first month of the program. It is required that participants score a minimum of 80% mark during the foundation stage of the curriculum.

The training for my cohort begins in a few days and to perform optimally, I have had to put some key things in place. 
That is what I'll share in this post: how I am preparing for the [ALX Software Engineering program](https://www.alxafrica.com/software-engineering-2022). This can also be a sort of guide for any Nigerian preparing for any intensive online training of this sort.


# Key things I'm putting in place in preparation for the ALX SE program:

**Alternative power supply:**

I live in Nigeria where there is an inconsistent power supply. The average daily power supply we get in my neighbourhood is eight hours; even at that, the supply is epileptic.
Before my acceptance into the ALX SE program, the alternative power supply in my home was a fuel-powered generator and with the hike in the price of fuel (Nigerian government factor), we had to limit the generator usage to only a few hours at night.
So my first challenge was getting a more consistent source of power supply. 
An inverter would have been the best option for an alternative source of power but considering the price of inverters and the financial implications installing one will have on my family, we opted for a solar system instead.
There were not many options to choose from so we settled for a reasonably priced solar system which powers my laptop, phones, led fan and supplies lighting through its accompanying led bulbs.
This at least provides regular power for my needed devices.

**A Laptop:**

A fully functional laptop is a requirement for the work of a developer therefore, it is necessary for the training of a Software Engineer. My Windows 10 laptop will serve well for this program. All I need to do is install the necessary programs on it.

**A Smartphone:**

A good smartphone is necessary to support the use of a laptop. With a smartphone, training activities and tasks can be done on the go. My Android version 11 with 6Gb RAM plus 128Gb ROM and a 7000mAh battery is suitable for me to run the program anytime I am OTG.

**WiFi or Mifi Wireless Network:**

Connecting to a wireless network is necessary for a stable internet connection. It is not advisable to connect laptops to the internet via a phone hotspot because of the harm hotspot causes to phone batteries. 
There are various options of wireless network services to choose from. My MTN Mifi will be handy for this purpose. 

**Data Supply:**

The best line of action for data supply will be to get an unlimited annual data supply for the duration of my training, but at the moment, I'll make do with a monthly data plan.

**Commitment, Dedication, Discipline:**

The need for commitment, dedication and discipline to go through the ALX SE program cannot be overemphasized.
I need these in my arsenal to be able to go through the rigours of this program in addition to the demands and responsibility of being a wife and mother. 
I have structured a plan that will free up more time for me to study. 
My social life will take a beating as I intend to drastically cut down on socialising for the next 12 months.
Having a plan is not enough, discipline to stick to the plan is required for success on this daunting path. 

**A Community of like minds:**

A community of like-minded people is one of the greatest assets to achieving meaningful success in this sort of training.
I have found that in the unofficial WhatsApp community of fellow ALX SE cohort nine participants waiting to begin the program along with me.
The community has greatly contributed to my resolute decision to go through the programme.

**An Open Mind:**

For a tech noob like me, an open mind to learn new concepts is a major prerequisite to succeed in a technical field such as Software Engineering. 
Right now, I am ready to learn like a child just beginning to read and write, and I am ready to learn from anyone willing to impart technical knowledge to me even if it is a child.

Like Shunryu Suzuki said, 
> "in the beginner's mind there are many possibilities, in the expert's mind there are few".

I am a beginner in tech, I have a beginner's mind, as far as technical knowledge is concerned, I know nothing, therefore I have an open mind for - 
> "the mind that opens up to a new idea never returns to its original size". - Albert Einstein.

Finally, in getting set for the formidable training style of [ALX](https://www.alxafrica.com/software-engineering-2022), I wrote a note to myself which I have pasted in every part of my home and which stirs me in the face at every turn:

*Dear Abimbola,*

*To succeed in this your chosen path to Software Engineering, you must persevere and stick with your mapped-out plan for success.*

*Some days will be walk-throughs while many days will be very challenging. Just remember, giving up is not an option.*

*You know you can do this, let nothing stop you. And as you do, pls remember to:*
